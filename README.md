# spine-hx

Spine runtime for Haxe ported from official AS3 runtime.

This repository was created because the other most recent spine runtime for haxe ([spinehaxe](https://github.com/bendmorris/spinehaxe)) doesn't seem to be updated anymore and is missing various new Spine features.

In order to be up to date and make it easy to add new updates, the code is staying as close as possible to the official ActionScript 3 runtime.

Current code is converted from: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/tree/16489aaf58aac43b1b3ebd9bf76fb47c6a2cd1b0
(Spine runtime v3.4, commit July 18 2016)

Updates will be possible by following the changes on the as3 runtime and simply applying them on the haxe code.
